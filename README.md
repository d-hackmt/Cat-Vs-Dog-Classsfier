# Dogs vs Cats Image Classifier 🐶🐱

## Welcome to my Dogs vs Cats image classifier project! 🚀 In this project, I used the power of deep learning to build a model that can accurately classify images of cats 🐱 and dogs 🐶. I mean, who wouldn't want to know whether that furry creature in their photo is a cat or a dog? 🤔

## Project Overview 👀

In this project, I downloaded and unzipped the Dogs vs Cats dataset from Kaggle, which contains thousands of images of cats and dogs 📷. Then, I preprocessed the images by resizing them to a standard size and converting them to arrays 🖼️. After that, I split the dataset into training and testing sets and loaded the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. I then added custom layers on top to adapt the model for the cats vs dogs classification task 🐾. Finally, I deployed the model as a web application using Flask, because who doesn't love a good web app? 🌐

## Libraries Used 📚

In this project, I used a variety of Python libraries 🐍 including NumPy, PIL, Matplotlib, Sklearn, cv2, glob, TensorFlow, and Keras. I also used MobileNetV2, a pre-trained deep learning model that is designed for mobile and embedded devices 📱.

## Transfer Learning 👀

Transfer learning is a technique in deep learning where a pre-trained model is used as the starting point for building a new model. In this project, I used transfer learning to build a cats vs dogs image classifier that was able to achieve high accuracy 🤖.

## Use Case 🤔

The use case for this project is pretty straightforward: classify images of cats and dogs! 📷 Whether you're a pet owner trying to figure out whether your furry friend is a cat or a dog, or a machine learning enthusiast interested in transfer learning, this project has something for everyone! 🤓

## Conclusion 🎉

In conclusion, this project was a great demonstration of the power of deep learning and its ability to solve complex problems with high accuracy. Plus, who doesn't love a good cat or dog photo? 🐶🐱 Thanks for checking out my project! 😊
